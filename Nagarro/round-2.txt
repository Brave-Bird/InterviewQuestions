This is a tech round that longed for 20-30m. These are the questions I was asked during the discussion

	a. avoid event bubbling javascript
	b. why initial value is static css
	c. how to use react error boundaries in react
	d. code splitting react
	e. benefits of redux-saga
	f. Object.seal vs object.freeze
    g. HOC example
